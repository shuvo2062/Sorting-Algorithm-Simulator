# Sorting-Algorithm-Simulator
Created By: Abu Selim Reza and Murad Ahmed

Includes following algorithm simulations:

a. Bubble sort
b. Quick Sort
c. Insertion Sort
d. Selection sort

We look forward development of our simulator. We strongly encourage you to fix the irratic behavior during recursive calls of Quick sort algo and anyone competent enough to implement merge sort algo in this project.

Thanks
